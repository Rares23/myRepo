						Parkour
					</h1>
					<p>
						Parkour is a holistic training discipline using movement that developed out of military obstacle course training. Practitioners aim to move quickly and efficiently through their environment using only their bodies and their surroundings to propel themselves, negotiating obstacles in between. They try to maintain as much momentum as possible without being unsafe. Parkour can include running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement and more, if they are the most suitable movements for the situation.

						Free Running
					</h1>
					<p>
						Free running is a form of urban acrobatics, in which participants, known as free runners, perform movements using the obstacles in the environment around them. It incorporates efficient movements from parkour and adds aesthetic movements, such as those seen in tricking or gymnastics, or variations on the original parkour movements. Flips and spins are examples of movements which are very rarely efficient, so wouldn't be classified as parkour, but would be used often in free running.
